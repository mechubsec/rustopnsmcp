//! Change-set lifecycle tools for OPNsense firewall aliases and filter
//! rules.
//!
//! OPNsense's alias and filter controllers have no candidate configuration,
//! no dry-run validation, and no checkpoint to roll back to. The seven tools
//! below implement the change-control lifecycle — plan, digest, human
//! approve, apply with drift check — over that immediate-write REST API as a
//! best-effort approximation, with explicit honesty about what cannot be
//! guaranteed. Each change set stages mutations against exactly one resource
//! kind; see [`crate::changeset::ResourceKind`].

         OPNsense writes each resource to config.xml immediately but does not load it into \
