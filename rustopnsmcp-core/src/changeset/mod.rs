//! Governed writes for OPNsense firewall aliases and filter rules, mapped
//! onto `mecmcp-changeset`'s change-set lifecycle.
//!
//! OPNsense's alias and filter controllers have no candidate configuration,
//! no dry-run validation separate from the write itself, and no checkpoint to
//! roll back to: `addItem`/`setItem`/`delItem` (aliases) and
//! `addRule`/`setRule`/`delRule` (filter rules) persist to `config.xml`
//! immediately, and `reconfigure`/`apply` is the only thing standing between
//! that and the live `pf` tables/ruleset. [`OpnsenseTransaction`] declares
//! this plainly via [`Atomicity`], so shared code that renders approval
//! prompts can say so rather than offering commit-confirmed semantics the
//! vendor cannot deliver — the same shape `rustunifimcp` and `rustpanosmcp`
//! already gate through.
//!
//! Scope: phase 2a governs aliases, phase 2b (this phase) adds filter rules.
//! A change set stages exactly one resource [`ResourceKind`] at a time —
//! [`validate::check_single_resource_kind`] refuses a mix — because
//! `reconfigure` and `apply` are separate device-side commits and this
//! server's apply lifecycle runs only one commit per batch.
